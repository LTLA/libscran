# A C++ library for single-cell data analysis

## Motivation

The **libscran** library takes the core parts of the [**scran**](https://github.com/MarioniLab/scran) Bioconductor package (as well as other useful bits from other packages) and implements them in C++.
The idea is to provide a light-weight library that can be easily embedded into wider applications without including the entire R/Bioconductor runtime.

## Dependencies

- A C++17-compliant compiler.
- The [**tatami**](https://github.com/LTLA/tatami) library for matrix representations.
